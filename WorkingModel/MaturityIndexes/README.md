## RABET-V Maturity Indexes

RABET-V evaluates the security, reliability, and usability of products and provides a set of maturity scores for each product version. RABET-V provides three maturity indexes:

* [Security Service Capability Maturity (SSCM) Index](Security_Services_Capability_Maturity_Index.md) - identifies the product's current capability level measured across ten security services.
* [Software Development Maturity (SDM) Index](Software_Development_Maturity_Index.md) - identifies the maturity of the technology provider's software development processes measured across 15 security practices and 2 usability/accessibility practices.
* [Security Services Architectural Maturity (SSAM) Index](Security_Services_Architectural_Maturity_Index) - identifies the maturity and reliability of the product architecture to support each of the ten security services.
