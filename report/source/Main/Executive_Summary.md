# Executive Summary

Quick recap, major findings, and major recommendations

Since 2019, CIS has been working to fill gaps in the security of non-voting election technology. This began with the publication of  [Security Best Practices for Non-Voting Election Technology Guide](https://www.cisecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Security-Best-Practices-Non-Voting-Election-Tech-Singles-19-Nov.pdf) and continued with the developing and piloting of the Rapid Architecture Based Election Technology Verification (RABET-V) process.

RABET-V is a unique approach to the verification of system security. Instead of employing a thorough and lengthy approach to testing, it uses an iterative, risk-based approach that supports rapid product changes by design. The risk estimate is based heavily on the product architecture and provider's software development processes. Lower risk changes are tested using streamlined testing methods; and higher risk changes are fully tested. This approach leverages and encourages modern software development, testing, and deployment practices. This unique approach also provides incentives for technology providers to design their products with stronger organizational processes and desired architectures, as this eases the testing process by reducing the time and cost associated with verification.

To determine the viability and effectiveness of RABET-V, CIS conducted a pilot in 2020 with the assistance of a steering committee made of election officials and the generous support from two technology providers who supplied their products for testing. Prior to conducting the pilot, CIS worked with a group of stakeholder to develop a set of research questions which would used to evaluate RABET-V. During the course of the pilot, the core team developed the detailed procedures necessary to perform each step in the RABET-V framework, which CIS first laid out in its white paper entitled [How to Improve Election Technology Verification](https://www.nass.org/sites/default/files/2020-01/white-paper-cis-nass-winter20.pdf). The sections contained in this report provide further details of the pilot in the support of the following conclusions.

1. RABET-V is a viable process for non-voting equipment - The pilot evaluated 2 electronic pollbooks and 1 election night reporting solution 
1. We can evaluate architecture and use it to assess risk of changes - the pilot completed 3 arch review on 3 very different architectures and developed a rubric to encapsulate arch maturity
1. We can evaluate software development processes and use the results to assess likelihood of positive security outcomes - the pilot completed process evaluation of two very different companies
1. We can develop a testing matrix that prescribes different levels of testing based on the type of change, the architecture maturity score, and process maturity score - the pilot defined 3 testing tiers and created a testing matrix to determine which tier to use based on the combination of the 3 inputs
1. Reevaluation of new product versions will be quicker for products with higher process and architecture maturity scores - the testing matrix provides for lower effort testing methods for high maturity scores
1. RABET-V can be run by a central administrator with various activities conducted by external specialists - CIS acted as administrator and contracted with specialists to perform activities such as process assessments, threat modeling, architecture models, and testing
1. RABET-V is compatible with multiple operational and economic models - the pilot developed a paper outlining the operational and economic models RABET-V could work with and validated it with the Steering Committee


The rest of this report is organized into sections. First, in section X, we provide a detailed recap of how the pilot was executed and discuss the variations from the initial plan to final execution. Next, in section X, we present our answers to the research questions - which were identified prior to the pilot - and discuss our related findings. In section X, we define possible operational and economic models for RABET-V. Finally, we conclude the report with recommendations for follow on RABET-V work and how to transition to a stable operation.
