# Pilot Program Recap  

In this section, we provide a recap of the pilot program and discuss the differences in initial expectations and the actual execution.

## Background

In 2019, the Center for Internet Security (CIS) began to work to fill gaps in the security of non-voting election systems. Non-voting election technology. There are both voting and non-voting types of election systems. A “voting system” is defined in the Help American Vote Act (H.R. 3295, Sec 301). A non-voting system is any other election technology system used during the election. Examples include voter registration databases, electronic pollbooks, or the websites of government election authorities.

First, CIS developed the [Security Best Practices for Non-Voting Election Technology Guide](https://www.cisecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Security-Best-Practices-Non-Voting-Election-Tech-Singles-19-Nov.pdf) to provide a comprehensive set of security best practices. At the conclusion of that effort, CIS began working on a process to verify election technology against those best practices. This effort produced the concept of Rapid Architecture Based Election Technology Verification (RABET-V).

RABET-V is a unique approach to the verification of system security. Instead of employing a thorough and lengthy approach to testing, it uses an iterative, risk-based approach that supports rapid product changes by design. The risk estimate is based heavily on the product architecture and provider's software development processes. Lower risk changes are tested using streamlined testing methods; and higher risk changes are fully tested. This approach leverages and encourages modern software development, testing, and deployment practices. This unique approach also provides incentives for technology providers to design their products with stronger organizational processes and desired architectures, as this eases the testing process by reducing the time and cost associated with verification.

After receiving input from various stakeholders in November of 2019, CIS developed the RABET-V framework and released it in a white paper entitled [How to Improve Election Technology Verification](https://www.nass.org/sites/default/files/2020-01/white-paper-cis-nass-winter20.pdf) during the NASS 2020 Winter Conference.

Based on the RABET-V Framework and with financial support from the Democracy Fund, CIS launched the first pilot of RABET-V in February 2020. The RABET-V Pilot Program was guided by a steering committee comprised of election officials, election technology providers, and other election infrastructure stakeholders. The steering committee included representatives from the states of Indiana, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin. Representatives from the Election Assistance Commission (EAC), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), National Association of State Election Directors (NASED), and the Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP) further comprised the steering committee.  Two technology providers volunteered their products and time to participate in the pilot. Knowink submitted their electronic pollbook, PollPad. VR Systems submitted their electronic pollbook, EViD, and their election night reporting solution. CIS also engaged with a group of technology experts who comprised a RABET-V technology advisory committee. 

The RABET-V Pilot first established a RABET-V Program Description. The Program Description is a detailed guide on how to run RABET-V. It was developed in early 2020 and was iteratively reviewed and modified by the pilot team and program Steering Committee, as necessary.

Using the Program Description, the Pilot Program conducted initial iterations on the technology providers' products. Each initial iteration of RABET-V executed all activities resulting in the creation of maturity scores for each product and a testing matrix to guide future iterations.
