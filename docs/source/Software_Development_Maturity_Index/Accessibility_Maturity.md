# Accessibility

Accessibility is often overlooked as a development priority. It may be hard for developers without a disability to conceptualize needing or using accessibility features, but itâ€™s easy to find examples that may be possible for anyone to imagine. For example, some software developers developed repetitive stress injuries and turned to speech-to-text aids to continue working in their profession. Beyond the general necessity, adhering to accessibility standards is often a hard requirement for software solutions in many state systems.

| Accessibility Maturity Levels | Quality Criteria | Required Activity |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Level 0                       |                  |                   |
| Level 1: automated conformance to accessibility guidelines | Performs automated accessibility validation during development. | Use automated testing tools during development for: <ul><li>All major releases (partial credit)</li><li>All significant changes to user interface functionality (full credit)</li><li>Other (no credit)</li></ul> |
| Level 2: Testing with accessibility tools | Perform accessibility tests with commercial accessibility software and OS-specific features, including using personas and scenarios | Use commercial software, OS-specific features, and personas and scenarios for:<ul><li>All major releases (partial credit)</li><li>All significant changes to user interface functionality (full credit)</li><li>Other (no credit)</li></ul> |
| Level 3: formal accessibility testing and analysis program | Use of research methods and usability experts to test prototypes with users that have accessibility needs. | Conduct accessibility testing and integrate results for: <ul><li>All major releases (partial credit)</li><li>All significant changes to user interface functionality (full credit)</li><li>Other (no credit)</li></ul> |
