# Security Services Capability Maturity Index

The SSCM Index provides a maturity score for each of ten security control families. The scores range from 0 to 3, where 3 is the best.

The scores are based on how well the product revision meets the security requirements set forth for each security control family. The requirements are pass/fail. Any assumptions made about the configuration or setup of the product must be documented with the result.

The scores are calculating for each security control family by taken the percentage of applicable requirements at each maturity level and multiplying that percentage by 1 resulting in a value between 0 and 1. Then, those values are summed to achieve a result between 0 and 3. This means that meeting 100% of maturity level 1 will result in 1.0 value which is added to the result for maturity levels 2 and 3.
