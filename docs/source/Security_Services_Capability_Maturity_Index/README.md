# Security Services Capability Maturity Index

The SSCM Index provides a maturity score for each of ten security services. The scores range from 0 to 3, where 3 is the best.

The scores are based on how well the product revision meets the security requirements set forth for each security service. These requirements are built from the [Security Best Practices for Non-Voting Election Technology](https://www.cisecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Security-Best-Practices-Non-Voting-Election-Tech-Singles-19-Nov.pdf).

To determine the maturity level for each security service, the RTP responds the following question:

1.  Are these technology controls or activities implemented in the product?

There are four permitted answers:

1.  No

1.  Yes, on some components

1.  Yes, on most components or on all components but they are provided manually

1.  Yes, on all components that require it

The maturity levels have consistent basic definitions across each security service:

  - Maturity level 0: The RTP has not implemented basic best practices across the product

  - Maturity level 1: The RTP has implemented the basic level best practices across the product

  - Maturity level 2: The RTP has implemented the basic and advanced best practices across the product

  - Maturity level 3: The RTP has implemented the basic, advanced, and specialized best practices across the product
