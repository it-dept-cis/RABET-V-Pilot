### Inputs

  - Provider’s submission package

  - Prior process review, if a revision submission

### Outputs

  - Submission Review Checklist indicating submission type, change list, and which RABET-V activities should be performed in this iteration

##### Revision submission

Some RABET-V activities may not be required. Complete the remainder of the steps in this process to determine which activities are required for this submission. For each step, indicate on the Submission Review Checklist if the respective item is present, missing, or not required.
