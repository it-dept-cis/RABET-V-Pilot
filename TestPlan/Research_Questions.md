# Pilot Research Questions

## Time and Cost Implications
1)	What are the review time implications of the RABET-V approach for:
-	The initial verification of a product from a new vendor?
-	The initial verification of a product from a vendor that have been through the RABET-V process?
-	The re-verification of a product?
2)	What are the total cost implications of the RABET-V approach for:
-	The initial verification of a product from a new vendor?
-	The initial verification of a product from a vendor that have been through the RABET-V process?
-	The re-verification of a product?
3)	Is there a viable economic model for the RABET-V process? If so:
-	Does it require a government agency to drive the program, similar to voting system certification?
-	Is there a model in which suppliers in the market can support?
-	Is there a model that states and localities can support?
4)	Will the process be efficient enough to keep costs low enough for vendors to make minor updates?
## Market Maturity Implications
5)	Is there evidence that products are architected in a manner that is mature enough for the RABET-V process to yield benefits by reducing the extent of re-verification reviews?
-	Will vendors be willing to submit small, frequent updates?
6)	Is there evidence that state and local adoption and acceptance processes can leverage the RABET-V process to yield benefits?
-	Can states and localities accept RABET-V verifications quickly enough to make the process worthwhile?
-	Will states and localities be willing to adopt new versions at a rate that maintains incentives to put small, more frequent updates through the process?
## Pre-Review Assessment Implications
7)	Is there a sufficient correlation between process assessment results and verification outcomes to use those assessments to expedite verification and re-verification under RABET-V?
8)	Should process assessments be renewed and, if so, how often or under what circumstances?
9)	What party is best equipped to conduct process assessments?
10)	Do architecture reviews provide a sufficient understanding of a given product to determine the impact of:
-	De minimus system changes?
-	Minor system changes?
-	Major system changes?
11)	Should architecture reviews be renewed and, if so, how often or under what circumstances?
12)	What party is best equipped to conduct architecture reviews?
## Technical Evaluation Implications
13)	For which types of non-voting election technology will the process work?
-	Is it better suited for some types of technology over others?
-	How, if at all, does the process have to be modified to make it more suitable?
-	Are vendors more likely to accept the RABET-V process for certain types of equipment?
-	Are states and localities more likely to accept the RABET-V process for certain types of equipment?
